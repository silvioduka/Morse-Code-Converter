Morse code is a method of transmitting text information as a series of on-off tones, lights, or clicks. 

Each letter or numeral is represented by a unique sequence of dots and dashes. 

Write a program that takes a string as input and converts it into Morse code. 

Some Examples: 

Input: SOS 

Output: ... --- ... 

Input: SoloLearn 

Output: ... --- .-.. --- .-.. . .- .-. -.
